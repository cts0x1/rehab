**Instructions:**
 *For TamperMonkey install.*
- Click [here.](https://github.com/cts0x1/rehab/raw/main/I%20Still%20Hate%20The%20New%20Rehab%20Button.user.js)
- It should redirect you to the TamperMonkey 'confirmation' page
 - If it doesn't, simply CTRL + A to select everything on the raw page, CTRL + C to copy, head to your Dashboard and hit the '+' next to the 'Installed Userscripts' tab.
- That's all.

**Instructions:**
 *For TornPDA install.* (TornPDA has not been tested yet but will be shortly.)
- Click [here](https://github.com/cts0x1/rehab/raw/main/I%20Still%20Hate%20The%20New%20Rehab%20Button.user.js) on your mobile device.
- Select and copy everything.
- Head to TornPDA, top left options, and hit 'Settings' at the bottom.
- You should be using the in-app browser, so click 'Advanced browser settings' and then 'Manage scripts'.
- From there, all you need to do is hit the '+' and paste it, type a name up top and head back to Torn.
